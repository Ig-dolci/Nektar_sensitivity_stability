Adjoint-based Sensivity/Stabilility Analyses
========
This repository is focused on adapting the Nektar++ to provide computations of sensitivity and stability analyses for fluid flow system, and fluid-structure insteraction system. On the last case, the structure is rigid and able only to translate.

Nektar ++ is an open-source software framework designed to support the
development of high-performance scalable solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs) using the spectral/hp element method.

The original software and User Guide are available for download from
<http://www.nektar.info/>.



Tutorials
---------
A number of tutorials are available, designed to walk the user through the
basics of spectral/hp element methods, through the use of individual solvers and
performing specific types of calculations.

The tutorials are available from <http://doc.nektar.info/tutorials/latest>.
